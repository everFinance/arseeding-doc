# Overview

To make it easy for developers to get started, we’ve deployed [web3infra.dev](http://web3infra.dev/) for developers to store data forever. This quick start will describe how to use arseeding-js to store data onto the Arweave network via [web3infra.dev](http://web3infra.dev/).

# Prerequiste

In order to quickly have the data uploaded, you need to have prepared in advanced the following:

1. node.js development environment
2. have a MetaMask wallet.
3. the wallet has any one of asset that listed on everPay.

If you’re not yet ready, please check the following: [everPay recharge guide](../other/2.getAR.md#everpay)

# Installation

Open your terminal and use the following command to install arseeding-js.

```bash
npm i arseeding-js
```

# Upload Data

After the installation is complete, create `demo.js` in the directory and copy the following code to `demo.js`:

```jsx
import { genNodeAPI } from 'arseeding-js'
const instance = await genNodeAPI('YOUR PRIVATE KEY')

const arseedUrl = 'https://arseed.web3infra.dev'
const data = Buffer.from('........')
const payCurrency = 'usdc' // everpay supported all tokens
const ops = {
    tags: [{name: "Content-Type",value:'data type'}]
}
const res = await instance.sendAndPay(arseedUrl, data, payCurrency, ops)
console.log('res',res)
```

Configuration instructions:

- Populate your MetaMask key with `YOUR PRIVATE KEY`. Make sure that the wallet corresponding to the PRIVATE KEY has assets on everPay.
- arseedUrl is the address of the Arseeding backend service that needs to be configured. Here we use the Arseed service provided by everFinance at [https://arseed.web3infra.dev](https://arseed.web3infra.dev/).
- The data needs to be filled with the binary data you want to upload, the developer can use the file io to read the corresponding file from the local drive.
- payCurrency is the payment token you need to choose. If your MetaMask address is held on everPay with usdc, please fill in usdc here, if it is held in any other token, please fill in the symbol of the said token.
- In ops you can configure your Arweave Tags, Arweave Tags refer to: [here](../other/tags.md).

When you’re ready to configure, call await instance.sendAndPay(arseedUrl, data, payCurrency, ops) to upload your data to the Arseeding node in web3infra.

Execute the following command in the terminal for upload files.

```bash
node demo.js
```

When executed correctly the terminal will output:

```bash
res {
  status: 'ok',
  everpayTx: {
    tokenSymbol: 'USDC',
    action: 'transfer',
    from: '0xDc19464589c1cfdD10AEdcC1d09336622b282652',
    to: 'uDA8ZblC-lyEFfsYXKewpwaX-kkNDDw8az3IW9bDL68',
    amount: '685',
    fee: '0',
    feeRecipient: '0x6451eB7f668de69Fb4C943Db72bCF2A73DeeC6B1',
    nonce: '1658805735973',
    tokenID: '0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48',
    chainType: 'ethereum',
    chainID: '1',
    data: '{"itemId":"iyosxBPXwPYXKYac31nEq3c5uDm4Wxsv0o-Yy8yaHvU","bundler":"uDA8ZblC-lyEFfsYXKewpwaX-kkNDDw8az3IW9bDL68","currency":"USDC","decimals":6,"fee":"685","paymentExpiredTime":1658809335,"expectedBlock":982245}',
    version: 'v1',
    sig: '0x12e9342863734b0c3d0bf09cf191a38e0266692a3a0114723904f5e3d5205310706d1d6eaff86bda2f19d8ee46becc4c9512b419ecae36be844bd43da52a6fa41b'
  },
  everHash: '0x2cd991fb67206ccc93976a20a892833fecce9ae5261d4570d6b6bb3eac3783e7',
  order: {
    itemId: 'iyosxBPXwPYXKYac31nEq3c5uDm4Wxsv0o-Yy8yaHvU',
    bundler: 'uDA8ZblC-lyEFfsYXKewpwaX-kkNDDw8az3IW9bDL68',
    currency: 'USDC',
    decimals: 6,
    fee: '685',
    paymentExpiredTime: 1658809335,
    expectedBlock: 982245
  }
}
```

Eventually this data will be packaged into the Arweave network becoming permanent and immutable.

# Download Data

In the returned result you can find `res.order.itemId`, the above itemId is `iyosxBPXwPYXKYac31nEq3c5uDm4Wxsv0o-Yy8yaHvU`.

The data can be downloaded using curl at:

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://arseed.web3infra.dev/iyosxBPXwPYXKYac31nEq3c5uDm4Wxsv0o-Yy8yaHvU'
```
