These two keys will be used when you access S3 with Arseeding (you need to save them well).

Also, S3 buckets cannot have the same name in the same region (e.g. Asia Pacific), you need to check which regions you can create buckets in and, when starting Arseeding, you need to provide an appropriate bucket prefix to ensure that the bucket you create does not have the same name as other s3 users' buckets.
