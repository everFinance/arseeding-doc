## Usage

When using the Web3infra service, you will need to have an Ethereum wallet or Arweave wallet. The wallet will be used to sign your data and will also be used to pay for the fees consumed by the storage. Then start sdk client

### Ethereum wallet creation

use wallet file
```java
String fileName = "your file";
Wallet ethereumWallet1 =
        EthereumWallet.loadEthereumWallet("your password", new File(fileName));
```
use private key
```java
Wallet ethereumWallet2 =
        EthereumWallet.loadEthereumWallet("your private key");
```

### Arweave Wallet Creation
Arweave wallets can be created using java, the official Arweave SDK currently recommended by Arweave, which is installed as follows:

```java
Wallet arweaveWallet = 
        ArweaveWallet.loadArWallet("your file path");
```

### Sdk Client Creation

```java
ArSeedingService arSeedingService =
        new HttpArSeedingService(arseedUrl, payUrl);
ArSDK arSDK = ArHttpSDK.buildArHttpSDK(arSeedingService, ethereumWallet);
```

See above for details on `payUrl` and `arseedUrl`.
